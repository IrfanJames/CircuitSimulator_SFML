Short-Term Goals
	* Make Quad-Trees Stable
	* Wires
	* State Machine
	* Optimize QuadTree qtUpdate()
	* Usable through Keyboard
	  * Move Components with Arrow Keys (Done, but collisions not implemented yet)
	  * Drag from Keyboard
	* Print sf::Clipboard::getString while Drap/Dropping Acrobat PDF into another Acrobat PDF Window


Issues
	* Wires aren't user friendly


Unstable
	* Crash in Option::Paste()
	* Crash in SaveAsImage() when image size is greater than allowed imgae-size


Stable
	* Procedual Background Grid
	* Collisions (even multiple elements)
	* Rotation, hold, Drag(smooth)
	* New Items at different places
	* Selection (, delete option, not rotate)
	* Delete
	* Save as Image
	* Save Projects
	* Open saved project
	* EndNodes, endNode-Circles
	* Copy/Paste
	* Enerything till Themes
	* QuadTree
	* Generating Graph from a circuit


Still Not Yet
