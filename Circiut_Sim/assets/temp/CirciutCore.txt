now give me code style advice on how should i start writing CircuitCore (performs circuit analysis) in my project above

Sure. Here are a few tips on how you can start writing the CircuitCore module in your project:

Define the scope and requirements of the CircuitCore module: Before you start writing code, it's important to understand what the CircuitCore module is supposed to do and what its requirements are. This will help you design an effective and efficient solution.

Break down the problem into smaller tasks: Circuit analysis can be a complex task, so it's a good idea to break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. For example, you could start by writing functions to parse and interpret circuit schematics, and then move on to functions that perform the actual analysis.

Use object-oriented design: To make your code more organized and easier to maintain, consider using object-oriented design principles. For example, you could define a Circuit class that represents a circuit and contains functions for analyzing it.

Use good coding practices: Make sure to follow good coding practices such as using descriptive variable names, adding comments, and using appropriate data types. This will make your code more readable and maintainable.

Test and debug your code: As you write the CircuitCore module, be sure to test and debug your code to ensure that it's working as expected. This will help you catch any errors or bugs early on, making it easier to fix them.












given that you have seen my code of CirciutGUI, and are aware of my code practices/style, and C++ knowledge; do you think I am able to complete this project(CircuitCore)

It is difficult for me to accurately assess your ability to complete the CircuitCore portion of your project without more information. In general, developing CircuitCore may require a strong understanding of electrical engineering concepts and the ability to implement them in code. It may also require a good understanding of data structures and algorithms for efficiently storing and manipulating the circuit data.

In terms of code style, it is generally good practice to modularize your code and follow a consistent style. This can make it easier to understand and maintain the code. You may also want to consider using version control software, such as Git, to track changes to your code and collaborate with other developers.

I recommend breaking the CircuitCore implementation down into smaller, manageable tasks and focusing on one task at a time. It may also be helpful to do some research and familiarize yourself with any relevant libraries or tools that may be useful for the project.

Ultimately, the success of your project will depend on your dedication, perseverance, and ability to learn and adapt as you encounter challenges along the way.
