now give me code style advice on how should i start writing CircuitCore (performs circuit analysis) in my project above

Sure. Here are a few tips on how you can start writing the CircuitCore module in your project:

Define the scope and requirements of the CircuitCore module: Before you start writing code, it's important to understand what the CircuitCore module is supposed to do and what its requirements are. This will help you design an effective and efficient solution.

Break down the problem into smaller tasks: Circuit analysis can be a complex task, so it's a good idea to break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. For example, you could start by writing functions to parse and interpret circuit schematics, and then move on to functions that perform the actual analysis.

Use object-oriented design: To make your code more organized and easier to maintain, consider using object-oriented design principles. For example, you could define a Circuit class that represents a circuit and contains functions for analyzing it.

Use good coding practices: Make sure to follow good coding practices such as using descriptive variable names, adding comments, and using appropriate data types. This will make your code more readable and maintainable.

Test and debug your code: As you write the CircuitCore module, be sure to test and debug your code to ensure that it's working as expected. This will help you catch any errors or bugs early on, making it easier to fix them.

given that you have seen my code of CirciutGUI, and are aware of my code practices/style, and C++ knowledge; do you think I am able to complete this project(CircuitCore)
It is difficult for me to accurately assess your ability to complete the CircuitCore portion of your project without more information. In general, developing CircuitCore may require a strong understanding of electrical engineering concepts and the ability to implement them in code. It may also require a good understanding of data structures and algorithms for efficiently storing and manipulating the circuit data.

In terms of code style, it is generally good practice to modularize your code and follow a consistent style. This can make it easier to understand and maintain the code. You may also want to consider using version control software, such as Git, to track changes to your code and collaborate with other developers.

I recommend breaking the CircuitCore implementation down into smaller, manageable tasks and focusing on one task at a time. It may also be helpful to do some research and familiarize yourself with any relevant libraries or tools that may be useful for the project.

Ultimately, the success of your project will depend on your dedication, perseverance, and ability to learn and adapt as you encounter challenges along the way.

I'm in my third year of Electrical Engineering.
Also, given that you have seen my code of CirciutGUI and are aware of my code practices/style and C++ knowledge; how long would you wager it would take me to complete this project.
It's difficult to give a precise estimate without more information about the scope of the CircuitCore project and your familiarity with the concepts involved in circuit analysis. However, as a general rule of thumb, it's always a good idea to break a large project down into smaller, more manageable tasks and tackle them one at a time. This can help make the project feel more manageable and help you make progress more quickly.

In terms of your C++ skills and your code practices, it's important to continuously learn and improve as you work on the project. It's also a good idea to get familiar with debugging tools and techniques, as well as testing and debugging strategies, to help you identify and fix any issues that may arise during the development process.

As you work on the CircuitCore project, it's also important to take breaks and take care of your physical and mental health. Working on a large project can be challenging and it's important to give yourself time to rest and recharge.

In summary, it's difficult to give a precise estimate on the amount of time it will take to complete the CircuitCore project without more information, but it's important to break the project down into smaller tasks, continuously learn and improve, and take care of your physical and mental health as you work.

in addition to general electrical engineering can you recommend a community or resource or discord or YouTube channel for "programming" a circuit simulator
Here are a few resources that may be helpful for programming a circuit simulator:

The Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange (https://electronics.stackexchange.com/) is a great community for asking questions and getting answers from experienced electrical engineers and programmers.

The Circuit Simulator subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/circuitsimulator/) is a forum for discussing circuit simulators and sharing resources and tips.

The SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) website (https://www.spice-simulation.com/) has a wealth of information on circuit simulation, including tutorials, software recommendations, and resources for learning more about circuit analysis.

The Electronics Engineering Stack Exchange (https://electronics.stackexchange.com/) is another online community where you can ask questions and get answers from experienced electrical engineers and programmers.

The National Instruments Circuit Design Community (https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/design-examples/circuit-design/overview.html) is a resource for learning about circuit simulation and design, including tutorials, software recommendations, and other resources.

YouTube channels such as The Cherno (https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject) and Learn Engineering (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8rJgYMlBcOHdG2KvxwlJUw) often cover topics related to programming and electrical engineering, and may have videos on circuit simulation specifically.

I hope these resources are helpful!
