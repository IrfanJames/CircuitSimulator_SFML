New------------------------------------
Text (1.2 mA)
drag by pressing scroll wheel
deleted while(!End) loop
assets/Images (assets/Fonts)
cursorInSim smooth*
win: default
win resizing: smooth**
toolColumn resizes with winResize(viewSize)
smartDisplay temp turned off (causes 100 cpu load)
repeated coad in (last of drag) & (resizing window) of tool column


Issues:--------------------------------
GL_INVALID_OPERATION The specified operation is not allowed in the current state.
*sometimes while hold+drag serialSprite comes up (occupied==1)
**somtimes resizing causes textue to pixelate (becomes normal when hold+drag)
paste causes pastes in all open windows


Unstable:------------------------------
When win minimized (hangs computer {all nust labs; mine at 3 windows}) [Possible cause Smart Display]
|__-> appearently solved by disabling stimuli display (x=1)
|
|__-> smart display(using): (normal cpu 25-30),(100)
|__-> smart display( not ): (normal cpu  6-15)


Stable:--------------------------------
Procedual Background Grid
Collisions include both nodes
Rotation, hold, Drag(smooth)
New Items at different places
Selection (, delete option, not rotate)
