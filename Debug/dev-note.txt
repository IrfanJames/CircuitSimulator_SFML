New------------------------------------
Drag Multiple components at once
Most of GUI in CircuitGUI namespace
Open/Save As Dialog Box
Toolbar Stablized
ImGui Status Bar
Selection on just Intersection with SelectionSquare
Ctrl + A -> Select All
Detecting Ctrl Key by just evnt not by nested if
PrintScreen Key can now be detected
Optimization Entity comp -> const Entity& comp
Click() now also uses time to dectect a Click
Components stay selected until a Click
Rotation an Delete independent of Mouse Pressed
Switch Open Close only affects the Swith directly beneath the cursor.
boarders
Text (1.2 mA)
drag by pressing scroll wheel
deleted while(!End) loop
assets/Images (assets/Fonts)
cursorInSim smooth*
win: default
win resizing: smooth**
toolColumn resizes with winResize(viewSize)
smartDisplay temp turned off (causes 100 cpu load)
repeated coad in (last of drag) & (resizing window) of tool column


Issues:--------------------------------
GL_INVALID_OPERATION The specified operation is not allowed in the current state.
**somtimes resizing causes textue to pixelate (becomes normal when hold+drag)


Unstable:------------------------------
When win minimized (hangs computer {all nust labs; mine at 3 windows}) [Possible cause Smart Display]
|__-> appearently solved by disabling stimuli display (x=1)
|
|__-> smart display(using): (normal cpu 25-30),(100)
|__-> smart display( not ): (normal cpu  6-15)


Stable:--------------------------------
Procedual Background Grid
Collisions include both nodes
Rotation, hold, Drag(smooth)
New Items at different places
Selection (, delete option, not rotate)
Delete
Save as Image(different names)
Smart Display (only on Stimuli)
Save Projects (different names)
Open latest saved project
EndNodes, endNode-Circles
Copy/Paste
